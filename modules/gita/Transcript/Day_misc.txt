And finally his argument against not fighting. 28 to 46. So, uh so, what we will do now, we will uh go to the chapter two today and uh we will focus today on again the organization of the chapter as we have done um and that will take the whole class today, organization of the chapter. And then we are going to read some of the purpose. Uh we will read the entire chapter. So first we will go through entire slokas. Then the the recitation of Sanskrit slokas and then we'll go verse by verse and sometime we will go through the purpose. Because we cannot go through the purpose of all 72 verses, but we'll go through. And then again take away from the chapter two and quoted verses. That is how we are going to uh cover chapter two. So now let us do this. Uh share. And uh Okay. Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

00:05:28 - 00:05:33
Speaker 5: Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

00:05:33 - 00:05:36
Speaker 1: Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

00:05:36 - 00:05:40
Speaker 5: Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

00:05:40 - 00:05:44
Speaker 1: Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

00:05:44 - 00:05:48
Speaker 5: Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya.

00:05:51 - 00:19:12
Speaker 1: Okay. So here is the organization of the chapter and you can see this chapter has five uh five section. So, first Arjuna surrenders to Lord Krishna. Verse number 1 to 9. So surrendering process is being described. from verse number 1 to 9. Understanding when you are confused, you must surrender to Krishna. And then understanding soul through Sankhya verses. Sorry, Sankhya analysis. Verses are from 10 to 30. So understanding the soul. Krishna is presenting what is soul. Right? So, that's a very because when an authority says that we are eternal, we are eternal. When an authority says we are the absolute authority. So Krishna being absolute authority is saying that we are uh we are uh eternal uh beings. Our individuality is permanent. So, so that explanation of the atomic soul is being described verse number 10 to 30. Understanding one's duty, I don't see this is through Sankhya, but we can say understanding one's duty based on nature. And as a as a Kshatriya, Arjuna should act because while we are soul, then one may say that uh because we are soul, so these material things we are not supposed to do. So while Krishna presented that we are soul, but simultaneously saying that you must act according to your material nature as well. While the the concern of the soul, concern for the soul should be there and our actions should be guided by the destination of the soul, but actions must be according to our duty. our nature. So Arjuna uh was uh told that you are a soul, but then you are a Kshatriya. So you have to act according to your Kshatriya nature, although you are a soul. So, while his Kshatriya nature was uh uh as explained, but as a soul, how do you behave? Right? There are two things. We have a material nature and we have a spiritual nature. So, while we act according to our material nature. So that was only uh you can see eight verses there. But then our spiritual nature, the action according to spiritual nature is Buddhi yoga, Krishna consciousness. So that is 39 to 53. Okay. And and then uh characteristics of a saintly person. So those who have gone beyond the body, those who don't have to act according to their nature. Okay, those who have I mean, I won't say that those who don't have to act according to nature, but those who want to perform action, uh perform sorry, uh that is uh you know, so there are three things here. We have material nature, how do we behave according to that nature? Second is that we are also soul. So that is the action in Krishna consciousness, Buddhi yoga. Right? But when those who are already perfected being, how do they behave? There must be an idea. So we have to behave according to Krishna consciousness, but then there should be some ideal when we practice Krishna consciousness, what is that we must ultimately uh expect for ourselves to reach, what must be our target before we give up this body. Is that clear? Anybody has any question about this chapter? Because this is a very important chapter and hence I would like all of you uh to understand. So, second chapter is the summary of the entire Bhagavad Gita. Lord Bhaktivinod Thakur uh explained in his Gita commentary that second chapter is the summary of the total uh Bhagavad Gita that is entire 18 chapter summary is in uh second chapter. So you can see that how it is uh beautifully organized this chapter summary as a summary. That uh what is the first step uh in our spiritual journey, we must learn how to surrender to Krishna. That means there is a process of surrendering to guru and Krishna. And then once you surrender, then uh you learn about the science of uh spirituality, that is uh the atma sakshatkar, the process of self-realization. So that was uh you know, the nature of the soul was described. Uh and then according to our material nature, we have certain action, according to spiritual nature, we have certain action, and how do perfected being behave? So, you see that there is a natural flow of uh uh the Bhagavad Gita uh second chapter. I hope you understood this. If anybody has any question, you can ask now on this. Or I will go forward. Okay. So now, what is the key verse? Just like we had a key verse in chapter one, 1.27 where Arjuna is overwhelmed with compassion. And and that is why this Arjuna yoga. So similarly, what is the key verse in second chapter? So whatever we may say about our spiritual practices, spiritual experience is the key. If we don't have spiritual experience, whatever we speak will enter one year and will come out of the second year. So this verse is vishaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinah rasavarjam rasopyasya param drishtva nivartate. The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the test for sense objects remains, but seizing such engagement by experiencing higher test, he is fixed in consciousness. Param drishtva nivartate. Param drishtva means experience of divinity. I cannot continue my spiritual life unless I have the experience of the divinity. So this is very, this is the key. I may hear I am soul, I am soul, I am soul, soul is unbreakable, soul is uh uh unburnt, uh you can't destroy it, unweight, you know, so all those can't be cut by the any weapon. It's fine. But unless you have that experience, which Krishna will tell in ninth chapter. Raja vidya rajyam pavitram. Pratyaksham. Sukam. So, pratyaksham. So we when we say spiritual practice means there must be direct realization. Spiritual experience must be there. So the and that is why any spiritual practitioner to have spiritual experience should always remain away from the senses. Senses must be withdrawn. It is better to close our eyes and memorize verses. Close our eyes, contemplate on the meaning of the verses. Close our eyes and critically uh critically uh analyze our material nature, our frailties. So, this this approach of withdrawing senses from the sense objects is very important. So, 2.59 is the samam of the chapter two. If we, you know, I may vishaya vinivartante. And there are people they are habituated to perform severe austerities. Like Sovari Muni, he was performing severe austerities because of that he got mystical opulence also. But he didn't have spiritual experience. Material austerities Material austerities can give you mystic opulence, but it cannot give you divine opulence. Divine opulence comes by grace of guru and Krishna. And that is the key. If I don't have divine experience, then I cannot continue in spiritual life. So now let us go a little summary of every section. Uh section one, Arjuna surrenders to Lord Krishna. Verse number 1 to 9. Uh so, maybe it is better that we we we we we we um read the entire chapter today together and and then go section wise, that way we can save our time. So I would request everybody to open their books and and we let us read uh or someone can uh I I I stop sharing and someone can uh show the verses. So that we can all read because that is a better way. Atha dvadasha atha dvitiyo adhyayah.

00:19:12 - 00:19:13
Speaker 5: Adhyayah.

Uh and uh uh so let's see Let us uh uh uh participants uh where are

00:36:06 - 00:36:07
Speaker 6: Ekta, are you there Ekta?

00:36:10 - 00:36:11
Speaker 1: Ekta is

00:36:15 - 00:36:18
Speaker 2: Can you read verse number one to three?

00:36:18 - 00:36:20
Speaker 1: Ekta is there?

00:36:21 - 00:36:24
Speaker 2: Hare Krishna Prabhuji. Ekta Mataji is not there.

00:36:25 - 00:36:42
Speaker 1: Okay. So, I think that you people should take the attendance. Uh we cannot give the certificate when people don't attend because this is a spiritual class. So it is very important that we are sincere in the classes.

00:36:43 - 00:36:44
Speaker 2: Okay, Lata.

00:36:45 - 00:36:47
Speaker 1: Can you read the verses one to three?

00:36:48 - 00:36:49
Speaker 2: Translation Prabhuji?

00:36:49 - 00:36:51
Speaker 1: Yeah, only translation.

00:36:51 - 00:37:30
Speaker 2: Okay Prabhuji. Sanjaya said, seeing Arjuna full of compassion, his mind depressed, his eyes full of tears, Madhusudana, Krishna spoke the following words. The supreme personality of Godhead said, my dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy. Oh son of Partha, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, oh chastiser of the enemy.

00:37:31 - 00:39:17
Speaker 1: Thank you. So, so you see this is Lord disapproves Arjuna's argument. From the very outset, he's not saying you are telling very uh your arguments are very good. You know, you are doing very well. No. He's completely saying that how have these impurities come upon you? He feels uh uh embarrassing that you are my friend. They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life. Anarya. Arya. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy. So this is a very, very uh very, very strong words. And when Krishna speaks, that must be something very special. And that is why in this context, the first purpose to uh that is the second verse, this purpose to this verse, second verse where Krishna started speaking, Prabhupad in the purpose rightfully, you know, you know, rightfully he what he's doing, he is establishing the authority of Krishna. When Krishna speaks, we must hear with obedience. So someone should read the translate the purpose of the second verse. Second verse purpose.

00:39:19 - 00:41:45
Speaker 2: Hare Krishna. Krishna and the supreme personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore, Lord Krishna is referred to as Bhagavan throughout the Gita. Bhagavan is the ultimate in the absolute truth. The absolute truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervading spirit, Paramatma or the localized aspects of the supreme within the heart of all living entities, and Bhagavan or the supreme personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, this conception of the absolute truth is explained thus. Vadanti tat tatva vidas tatvam. ajnya jnanam advayam Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti shabdate. The absolute truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the absolute truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the absolute truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface, and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sun shine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun's surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine, its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature, may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the absolute truth. The students who are advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramatma feature of the absolute truth. And the students who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal feature of the supreme personality of Godhead. Supreme absolute truth. Therefore, the bhaktas or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavan feature of the absolute truth are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the absolute truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc, and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit

00:41:45 - 00:42:06
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So, let us chant whatever has been uh uh written by Srila Prabhupada until now. So, what what is there? What is the what is uh uh the essence of this Krishna what you have studied uh Kalyani Mataji?

00:42:07 - 00:42:31
Speaker 4: Hare Krishna. Uh Bhagavan has three features that uh um Bhagavan, Paramatma and Brahman. Although they are different aspects of Krishna, but all are same. But the students who are try to understand Krishna are different categories. Uh the primary ones are only they can understand Bhagavan feature of the

00:42:31 - 00:42:32
Speaker 1: Hmm.

00:42:32 - 00:43:09
Speaker 4: Brahman feature of the uh supreme Lord. Uh the effulgent rays which is coming from Krishna's body, they can only understand that Brahman feature only. And the further more, they they are understanding the Paramatma feature of the supreme personality of of Godhead who is situated in everyone's heart as a Paramatma. And then the the topmost transcendentalist, they can only understand the God as a person, the Bhagavan himself. There is the uh example.

00:43:09 - 00:48:58
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, okay, okay, fine. See, uh uh Srila Prabhupada is invoking the idea of the absolute truth. Okay. So he's quoting the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam. Vadanti tat tattva vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam. Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti shabdate. Very powerful. The absolute truth is progressively realized by different transcendentalists in ascending order. First as Brahman, then as Paramatma, and ultimately Bhagavan. And Krishna has been referred all through the Bhagavad all through the Bhagavad Gita as Sri Bhagavan Uvacha. Full stop. This is the So first Prabhupada is saying Krishna has been described as Bhagavan. And when he's been described as a Bhagavan, what is this word Bhagavan? Brahmeti, lower, little higher, Paramatma iti, and then Bhagavan. Is the ultimate realization. And Prabhupada gives the uh sun uh example. Sun ray, all pervasive. Sun surface, Paramatma. And sun planet. That is the complete uh uh that is the complete uh description of the absolute truth. So complete uh description of the absolute truth. So this is we have to understand that uh Brahmeti Paramatmeti Bhagavan iti shabdate. Absolute truth is understood in three different ways. When one uh becomes free from the material influences through uh austerities, through cultivation of knowledge, then one recognizes the Brahman aspect of oneself. That I'm eternal and joyful. And then there are two categories, one is Brahmavadi, the other is Mayavadi. Mayavadi consider themselves to be one with that absolute. Because when you understand your eternal nature, you kind of realize that the my source must be of that nature. Because I have not done any service, I have not developed a bhakti, so I don't see my spiritual form. My spiritual form in Brahman realization is so dormant that I still think as a Brahmavadi, the absolute truth is uh all pervasive. And then when I go further, I analyze more in terms of diversity, then I see there is the super soul who is all pervading. And again, there are devotee uh kind of half devotee kind of people who recognize that Paramatma is master and I am the servant. Whereas then there are others who are Mayavadis, they accept this Paramatma to be self. And finally, you have Bhagavan. There is no confusion. In Bhagavan, there is only one master and everybody else are servant. And this is where Srila Prabhupada is saying that Krishna has been declared all through Bhagavad Gita as Bhagavan. And that that is the end description of the absolute truth. That means Krishna is the complete description of the absolute truth. Now let's go to next thing. Who is who will read the next rest of the purport? See, I am not able to see people. Krishna. Ah.

00:48:59 - 00:49:00

00:49:57 - 00:49:59
Speaker 1: That has been that has been studied already.

00:49:59 - 00:50:01
Speaker 7: Yes, Prabhuji, that has been done.

00:50:01 - 00:50:03
Speaker 1: So, you read the next one.

00:50:04 - 00:50:06

00:50:07 - 00:50:08
Speaker 1: Ah.

00:50:08 - 00:50:09
Speaker 8: Yes.

00:50:09 - 00:50:16
Speaker 9: Please Mataji read from there. The Sanskrit word Bhagavan is explained by the great great authority Parashar Muni.

00:50:18 - 00:50:19
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:50:21 - 00:50:23
Speaker 9: Hare Krishna Mataji, please read from there.

00:50:24 - 00:50:25
Speaker 8: Yes, yes, Mataji.

00:50:28 - 00:50:29
Speaker 9: It's a fourth para, Mataji.

00:50:33 - 00:50:34
Speaker 1: You have the book?

00:50:36 - 00:50:38
Speaker 8: Yes, Prabhuji.

00:50:38 - 00:50:39
Speaker 1: So read.

00:50:41 - 00:50:43
Speaker 8: There are many Prabhuji next

00:50:44 - 00:50:46
Speaker 9: Mataji, see now there is Ishwara Parama Krishna.

00:50:47 - 00:50:49
Speaker 8: You know, the verse.

00:50:49 - 00:50:51
Speaker 9: About that there is

00:50:51 - 00:50:54
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, we are getting delayed. Mahasundari, you read.

00:50:58 - 00:53:18
Speaker 10: The Sanskrit word Bhagavan is explained by the great authority Parashar Muni, the father of Vyasadeva. The supreme personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge, and all renunciation is called Bhagavan. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Krishna can claim this because he is the supreme personality of Godhead. No living entity including Brahma, Lord Shiva or Narayan can possess opulence as fully as Krishna. Therefore, it is concluded in the Brahma Samhita by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above him. He is the primeval Lord or Bhagavan, known as Govinda, and he is the supreme cause of all causes. Ishwara Parama Krishna Satchidananda Vigraha Anadiradir Govinda Sarva Karana Karanam. There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavan, but Krishna is the supreme because none can excel him. He is the supreme person and his body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes. Brahma Samhita 5.1. In the Bhagavatam also, there is a list of many incarnations of the supreme personality of Godhead, but Krishna is described as the original personality of Godhead from whom many, many incarnations and personalities of Godhead expand. Ete chamsa kala pumsah Krishnastu Bhagavan svayam Indrari vyakulam lokam mridyanti yuge yuge. All the list of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the supreme Godhead, but Krishna is the supreme personality of Godhead himself. Bhagavatam 1.3.28. Therefore, Krishna is the original supreme personality of Godhead, the absolute truth, the source of both the super soul and the impersonal Brahman.

00:53:19 - 00:53:20
Speaker 1: In the present

00:53:20 - 00:53:21
Speaker 10: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:53:21 - 00:53:27
Speaker 1: Don't stop there, stop there, stop there. So please tell the whatever you read, what is the essence?

00:53:28 - 00:54:15
Speaker 10: Prabhuji, as you told that Prabhupad ne is in in this sloka Prabhupad has focused on the personality of the on the person feature of the Lord and has also told that there are many celebrities who can have so many opulences, but only Krishna is the one who has all six opulences at one time. Uh this is one thing and after that Krishna has uh Prabhupad has told that there are many uh incarnations, but Krishna is a fountain head of all the incarnations and Prabhupad has supported this with Bhagavatam 1.3.28. Ete chamsa means there are many but Krishna is a supreme.

00:54:16 - 00:56:16
Speaker 1: Thank you. Thank you uh for the. So, first is as according to Shastra, Bhagavan feature is the highest, topmost feature of the absolute truth. And Krishna has been addressed throughout the Bhagavad Gita as the Bhagavan. And then what is the definition of Bhagavan? Parashar Muni defines Bhagavan as he who possesses everything. So whatever I possess, ultimately is within Krishna. Whatever you possess is within Krishna. So Krishna possesses everything. And that is why Prabhupada quotes the verse by Brahmaji. Ishwara Parama Krishna Satchidananda Vigraha Anadiradir Govinda Sarva Karana Karanam. And then people may start arguing that why not Vishnu, why not Narayana, why not Padmanabha? And then Prabhupada quotes the verse from Srimad Bhagavatam to establish that Krishna is the only avatari. Every every every aspect of the absolute truth are only partial manifestation of Krishna. Whether it is Vishnu, whether it is Rama, whether it is uh Dwarkadhish, all other features are only partial. So, so this is uh this is where uh Prabhupada brought or took the story further. Now the last portion, Krishna Mataji, are you able to now follow how we are reading? Can you read the last paragraph in this lesson in this purport? Krishna Saha.

00:56:25 - 00:58:22
Speaker 7: In the presence of the supreme personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for the kinsman is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Krishna expressed his surprise with the word Kutaha, where from such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans. The word Aryan is applicable to person who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not do not know that the aim of life is realization of absolute truth, uh Vishnu or Bhagavan, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Uh person who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans. Although Arjuna was a kshatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting in the non-Aryans. Such a deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Krishna did not approve of the of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsman.

00:58:24 - 00:58:29
Speaker 1: Thank you. So, can you tell me what is the essence of what you read?

00:58:30 - 00:59:39
Speaker 7: Prabhuji, because Arjuna was very confusing state, so he was he was giving the reason uh to Lord Krishna why he is not he don't want to fight with his own friends and brother. So uh uh actually he was running, he was he want he don't want to fight and he he want to get out from this war condition and he was thinking more about materialist thing. So then Krishna was uh in this purport, the person who is who is not following his duty and he who is always uh realized always the material things, he cannot be Aryan. So Krishna wanted to make him understand that he should fight and he he don't need to think about material thing, but he has to do something to understand the absolute truth.

00:59:40 - 00:59:41
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:59:41 - 00:59:57
Speaker 7: So uh thank you. So what is what is what is in this ultimate concluding uh paragraph of the purport by Srila Prabhupada is that we should do our duty.

00:59:57 - 01:02:18
Speaker 1: We should we should Yeah, yeah, fine. Yes, yes. You you you told your point. So, I'm just uh uh concluding that all thing. As saying is that suppose, you know, uh uh I I know uh Radhakant Das for last 20 years, 22 years, uh 20 years or 22 years. And suddenly he says and tells me that I will go back to my materialistic life. So it will be shock for me. Unexpected. So when you trust someone, you have given so much of association of yourself to someone and he or she behaves in a completely uh unexpected manner, you get puzzled. And that's exactly Krishna is telling Arjuna, I could not expect this from you. After all, who among the Pandavas who has received the personal association of Krishna more than Arjuna? So that's why Prabhupada is saying, where from? From where you got these impurities in everything is. Right? So this is uh something that we have to understand that ultimately, when we associate with Krishna, the proof of the pudding is how we are always in Krishna consciousness. So, as all of you know that Arjuna is uh he is in confusion not because he is confused, but he has been put under illusion and anybody put under illusion by Krishna would behave like this. Now, verse number four to eight. Sachin, can you read?

01:02:21 - 01:02:22
Speaker 11: Yes, sir.

01:02:23 - 01:02:26
Speaker 1: Read carefully and then tell the essence.

01:02:27 - 01:03:35
Speaker 11: Uh Arjuna said, O killer of enemies, O killer of Madhu, how can I counteract with arrows in battle men like Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship? It would be better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers. Even though desiring worldly gain, they are superiors. If they are killed, everything we enjoy will be tainted with blood. Nor do we know which is better, conquering them or being conquered by them. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, we should not care to live. Yet, they are now standing before us on the battlefield. Now I'm confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness. In this condition, I am asking you to tell me for what is best for me. Now I am your disciple and a soul surrendered onto you. Please instruct me. I can find no means to drive away this grief which is driving up my senses. I will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous, unrivaled kingdom on earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.

01:03:36 - 01:03:40
Speaker 1: Read also the last verse in this section. Ninth verse.

01:03:42 - 01:03:50
Speaker 11: Sanjay said, having spoken thus, Arjuna, chastiser of enemies, told Krishna, Govinda, I shall not fight and fell silent.

01:03:51 - 01:03:54
Speaker 1: So now Arjuna is silent.

01:03:54 - 01:03:55
Speaker 11: Yes.

01:03:55 - 01:05:43
Speaker 1: So when you surrender to Krishna, you must be silent. You must be ready to hear your master. Arjuna has surrendered to Krishna. And after speaking his mind, he is silent. He's waiting for the instructions of Krishna. That will come boom, boom, boom. Okay. So when a pure devotee enters into difficulties, surrender to Krishna. Arjuna was in depression but surrendered to Krishna. Generally, in depression, one in material consciousness degrades further. This normally happens. If you are materially depressed, your situation will become worse and worse and worse. But in case of Arjuna, he surrendered to Krishna. That means although he is influenced by Krishna to enter into confusion, but he seek the shelter of Krishna. Because in surrender to Krishna, the divine knowledge manifest and ignorance is dissipated. So, in this section, we'll read one more purpose. Who will read the purpose?

01:05:44 - 01:05:46
Speaker 12: I will read Prabhuji. Hare Krishna.

01:05:47 - 01:05:48
Speaker 1: What is your name?

01:05:48 - 01:05:49
Speaker 12: Tanya.

01:05:50 - 01:05:54
Speaker 1: Tanya? Tanya, please read.

01:05:56 - 01:05:57
Speaker 12: Text four Prabhuji.

01:05:58 - 01:05:59
Speaker 1: Seven, seven, seven.

01:06:00 - 01:07:35
Speaker 12: Okay. Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness. In this condition, I am asking you to tell me for certain what is best for me. Now I am your disciple and a soul surrendered onto you. Please instruct me. Perpert. By nature's own ways, the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step, there is perplexity. And therefore, it behooves one to approach a bonafide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bonafide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire and yet it takes place and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciple succession. A person with a bonafide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not therefore remain in material perplexities, but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purpose of this verse.

01:07:37 - 01:07:38
Speaker 1: Who is the man?

01:07:39 - 01:07:41
Speaker 12: First, you summarize that part.

01:07:42 - 01:07:42
Speaker 1: Hanji Prabhuji.

01:07:43 - 01:08:20
Speaker 12: So, in this, uh it's told that how this material world is like a forest fire which is not set by anyone. It's there. And this like world is full of perplexities and the purpose of the human is to find the spiritual master, surrender onto him and then follow the path that can uh help us to get out of to get free from this world. And here, uh now Arjuna is surrendering to Krishna. And he's telling him to instruct him.

01:08:22 - 01:10:09
Speaker 1: So, perplexity in material life is natural. It doesn't matter who you are, how well you are situated, you may be a big celebrity, but you enter into depression. You are a very intelligent person, very famous person, but you are hunted by infamy. Anything can happen in this material world. So perplexities are not a surprise within this material world. It comes to everyone. Everyone, just like, you know, we all, you know, when we attain adulthood and we start earning, then everybody says you must get married, then that will your make your life happy. And if you are thinking the marriage will make your life happy, and those who are married, you ask them. Just like somebody says I enter into IIT, I'll become happy. And they enter into IIT, you ask their life. They must be condemning, why did I come here? Because this is not taught to us. The life in material conception is very puzzling. So continue the next paragraph, Tanya.

01:10:14 - 01:11:22
Speaker 12: Who is the man in material perplexities? It is who it is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad, the perplexed man is described as follows. Yova etad aksharam Gargi avad vasmal lokat priti sa kripana. He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits the world like the cats and dogs without understanding the science of self- realization. This human form of life is the most valuable asset for the living entity who can utilize it for solving the problems of life. Therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is brahmana or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad aksharam Gargi vidit vasmal lokat priti sa brahmana.

01:11:23 - 01:13:03
Speaker 1: Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. So, so, what is the here is the who who normally enters into perplexity of life? Krupana. Who is a krupana? Who doesn't want to solve the problem of human life. What is the problem of human life? Birth, death, old age and disease. A krupana doesn't want to solve that problem. He dies like cats and dogs. A krupana doesn't surrender to a bonafide spiritual master like Arjuna is surrendering to Krishna, the original spiritual master of everyone. So, getting a human body but not surrendering to Krishna, surrendering to guru is a crime. It's a krupana. Try to understand this. And once you are a krupana, you will always fall in the uh uh you will be affected by perplexities of life. So, that's why Prabhupada is saying, who is the man in material perplexities? All krupanas. Anybody who doesn't want to solve the problem of human life. Who think that human life is a permanent business.

01:13:19 - 01:13:20
Speaker 13: Yeah.

01:13:25 - 01:13:34
Speaker 1: Narsimha Krupadevi Dasi, can you read? Is she hearing? Okay, Krishna Vinod.

01:13:36 - 01:13:38
Speaker 12: Krishna Vinod, please read.

01:13:38 - 01:13:39
Speaker 14: Yeah.

01:13:40 - 01:13:40
Speaker 12: Hare Krishna Prabhuji.

01:13:40 - 01:13:43
Speaker 1: The krupanas or my

01:13:44 - 01:13:45
Speaker 12: Hare Krishna Prabhuji.

01:13:47 - 01:13:53
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So now Krishna Vinod is reading. Let let him read. Okay.

01:13:54 - 01:16:00
Speaker 14: Hm. Yeah, the krupanas or miserly persons waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely of namely to wife, children and other members on the basis of skin disease. The krupana thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death, or the krupana thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Krishna, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to Krishna as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Krishna is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad Gita, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the Gita. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad Gita is stated in the Gita itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to Krishna as a person, but to the unborn within Krishna. There is no difference between Krishna's within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad Gita.

01:16:03 - 01:20:25
Speaker 1: So, so, so what is happening here? That people read Bhagavad Gita but without understanding the supreme authority, Krishna is the supreme authority. The moment you take Krishna as an ordinary authority, you will give interpretation to whatever he speaks. Like suppose I speak to all of you, you may disagree that I don't agree with you. But when Krishna speaks, you cannot disagree with him. If you are serious in spiritual life, if Krishna speaks, you have to accept whatever he says. So, Krishna being the highest authority, we have to accept him as he has presented himself in Bhagavad Gita. As we will see in the coming chapters. So when he says, you have to accept it literally. When Krishna is saying all the time he's presenting himself, although as the absolute truth, but simultaneously as a person. We have to accept him in that way. But krupanas, they cannot follow Krishna's guidance. So they read Bhagavad Gita, but they give a wrong interpretation. Always our argument is based on our material affinity. Because we have a bondage with matter, whatever we will speak will be nonsense. That is why there is a process to become free from this skin disease, material affection. Material affection is not only the way Arjuna is showing for his uh grandson, Bhishma and guru, Dronacharya and others, but material affection includes uh affection for uh wealth, intelligence, knowledge, all those are skin disease. And such skin disease, if it is there, one has to recognize that I have a disease. I need support. And hence, I must surrender to a bonafide spiritual master. I must surrender to Krishna. So we cannot uh you know, there is a very important uh uh purport in the uh text eight, but it is already 8 o'clock. And uh so maybe uh because this is a very important uh the purport of eight verse also is very important. Today, maybe we'll start that tomorrow before we go to the next section. That is the description of the soul. through Sankhya or understanding the soul through Sankhya. And so we will read this. So we end today's discussion now and you can ask questions.

01:20:34 - 01:20:36
Speaker 11: Hare Krishna sir.

01:20:37 - 01:20:37
Speaker 1: Ah.

01:20:38 - 01:21:11
Speaker 11: Sir, I have a question like in shloka hai jo Bhagavatam ka ki vadanti tat like there are different three aspects of the supreme absolute truth. Uh like Brahman aspect, Paramatma aspect and the Bhagwan aspect. So like as a devotee we generally accept like Ishwara parama Krishna but our understanding like for like we don't have even have like Brahman understanding or the Paramatma understanding. So like where we will stand in this category? If there are three aspects.

01:21:12 - 01:21:13
Speaker 1: You are not realized, no?

01:21:13 - 01:21:14
Speaker 11: Yes, sir.

01:21:16 - 01:22:05
Speaker 1: It is said, those who have seen the truth. Those who have seen the truth. Vadanti tat tatvavidas, tatvavidas. Okay. So we are trying to see Krishna or the absolute truth as Bhagavan by through the process of guru parampara. Ah. So we are uh KG1, KG2 student in spiritual life. Is that clear, Sachin?

01:22:05 - 01:22:05
Speaker 11: Yes, sir.

01:22:06 - 01:22:07
Speaker 1: Hasmukh.

01:22:09 - 01:22:11
Speaker 15: Hare Krishna Prabhuji.

01:22:11 - 01:22:11
Speaker 1: Ah.

01:22:14 - 01:22:40
Speaker 15: Prabhuji my question is maine aise suna ki the puri Bhagavad Gita ke andar jo do shloka hai jo bahut hi mahatvapurna hai matlab bola hai ki sharanagati Bhagavad Gita ka saar jo hai sharanagati hai to hum ye karma yog, gyan yog ye sab humko sikhne ki kya itni matlab avashyakta kya hai kya surrender hone ke liye sab cheezon ki avashyakta hai?

01:22:46 - 01:25:02
Speaker 1: Bhagavad Gita is not only for you. Bhagavad Gita is for everyone. And Bhagavad Gita addresses to all categories of people in different moods. And hence the story slowly develops. From chapter two onwards, the story develops. in a way that we can appreciate pure devotional service completely. Now, as we saw in the summary of Bhagavad Gita in second chapter, Krishna only talked about Buddhi yoga and which is later confirmed as Krishna consciousness, bhakti yoga. So, the science of soul, then action according to your nature, action according to your spiritual nature, and actions of those who are perfected. So this is the summary of the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita. So if you look at this summary, that is unfolding, that that summary will be unfold progressively because Krishna is addressing everyone. He's not addressing only Arjuna or you or me. Mahasundari. Then Kalyani, then Binu.

01:25:03 - 01:25:45
Speaker 10: Hare Krishna Prabhuji. Thank you for today's session. Uh Prabhuji, one question is why Sri Bhagwan is used like Prabhupad Sri Krishna Uvach ye hamesha ek chota sa doubt mind mein aata hai ki Sri Krishna Uvach kyu nahi likh sakte hain like agar hum mention kar rahe hain Ishwara parama Krishna aur jaise Prabhupad was very fixed that we will name the society as International Society for Krishna consciousness and not International Society for God consciousness. To usse ye doubt ek utpann hua. Maybe kuch galat ho. Aap please clear kar dijiye.

01:25:46 - 01:27:09
Speaker 1: No, good question. Good question. The one is concept. When we say Krishna, people may attach their sentiment. Whereas absolute truth as a concept has to be understood first. So absolute truth as a concept has three denomination. Preliminary denomination is Brahman. Little better is Paramatma. And the ultimate or the complete denomination is Bhagwan. So everybody knows Sri Krishna is speaking. There is no doubt because it is in the middle of the Bhagavad Gita, middle of the Mahabharata. So there is no confusion in that. So Sri Krishna if you would have written also, you know, later, but when he wrote Sri Bhagavan Uvacha, that means Vyasadeva is establishing that Krishna is the ultimate form of the absolute truth. Kalyani.

01:27:13 - 01:27:20
Speaker 4: Hare Krishna Prabhuji. Prabhuji, what is the destination for the people who realize Paramatma feature of the Lord?

01:27:23 - 01:29:07
Speaker 1: Those who realizes Paramatma feature, it is like what is his name? Uh Durvasa. Durvasa was a yogi. But later he became a devotee. He was residing on the eastern bank of Yamuna and teaching Gopis, you know, Gopis, nobody should actually dare to teach Gopis, but he was teaching Gopis that Krishna is the best of Brahmacharis. So, in the beginning, they are very powerful because by uh understanding Paramatma, they attain mystic potency. So, he can give benediction, he can give you curse, he can travel from one planet to another planet without any difficulty. But they don't go back to Godhead. Okay. So, but opportunity is given to such people to become a devotee. Binu Mataji. But as as I told you, in Kaliyuga, normally such people, they think they are also Paramatma. So that is Mayavadism. It's a wrong philosophy. Binu Mataji.

01:29:08 - 01:29:16
Speaker 16: Hare Krishna Prabhuji. Prabhuji, you just said in this purport seven that perplexity in material life is natural.

01:29:17 - 01:29:18
Speaker 1: And

01:29:18 - 01:29:20
Speaker 16: we all get perplexed.

01:29:20 - 01:29:43
Speaker 1: For a kripana, for a kripana, for a kripana. For everyone it is there, but we don't get confused. You know, those who are uh uh the the those who are uh you know, seasoned devotees, uh they are not perplexed. They know, okay, situation has come and Krishna will clear it. I need to be focused only in Krishna consciousness.

01:29:43 - 01:29:50
Speaker 16: Yeah, this perplexity is due to the ignorance or uh because so that ignorance

01:29:50 - 01:30:04
Speaker 1: Because of your affection for matter, skin disease. You are not interested to solve your problem, real problem, birth, death, old age and disease.

01:30:10 - 01:30:20
Speaker 16: So is that clear? In a way we cannot say that that I am in ignorance, I am not I am not associating myself as soul. I am just considering myself as matter.

01:30:22 - 01:30:32
Speaker 1: No, no, it is not the consider. Even if you understand you are a soul, but your attachment for the matter will enter make you enter into the perplexity.

01:30:33 - 01:30:34
Speaker 16: Okay.

01:30:38 - 01:31:49
Speaker 1: You know, we are all beginners in practicing Krishna consciousness and some difficulties come, we give up our Krishna consciousness. By speaking to thousands, we may find one who would remain until death fixed in Krishna consciousness. That is the statistics. That's what Krishna is saying. Manushyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye yatatam api siddhanam kascid mam vetti tattvatah. So as long as we have connection with matter, and that is what I was telling yesterday, the Dhritarashtra situation and our situation, most of the time are non-different. We know everything, but we don't want to act on knowledge. If knowledge is given to us, but we don't act on the knowledge, then we are we will be in the perplexities of life. Clear?

01:31:50 - 01:31:52
Speaker 16: Yes, Prabhuji. Thank you, Prabhuji.

01:31:53 - 01:31:53
Speaker 1: Sangeeta.

01:31:56 - 01:32:18
Speaker 17: Uh Hare Krishna Prabhuji. Prabhuji, my question is that Vishnu is a partial manifestation of Krishna. Then how can we understand that Vishnu and Krishna is non-different? Because we know that as Acharyas have said that they are non-different and there are other manifestation also was non-different, but

01:32:18 - 01:33:48
Speaker 1: They are non-different in the sense that they are complete. Vishnu is complete, Narayana is complete, Rama is complete, Krishna is complete. They exist independently. They are non-different in the sense that the complete opulence is only there with Krishna and Krishna hides himself as Vishnu, he hides some of his opulences. So as of now, we don't have to make a distinction between them. Because we are so ignorant, if we start doing that, we'll do it materially. So we should not speculate about the distinction between Krishna and Vishnu. Actually, it is better for us to realize there is no distinction between them. Madhavi Gauri.

01:33:51 - 01:34:01
Speaker 18: Hare Krishna Prabhuji. Prabhuji, is there any specific reason to use the word Kbyam by Krishna which is quite a very heavy word for a kshatriya like Arjun?

01:34:02 - 01:34:49
Speaker 1: Because he behaved like that. Sometimes strong words act. Sometimes strong words act. When Arjuna is saying that I will remain unarmed and let Duryodhan come and kill me. What kind of words you can use? When we engage some people in devotional service, sometimes they go so crazy that you have to use very strong word to bring them to their senses.

01:34:53 - 01:34:57
Speaker 18: So can we understand to churn Arjun's consciousness?

01:34:57 - 01:35:57
Speaker 1: Because he was using those words. The words is like that. Yes, Krishna is using that word. And Krishna is using for a person with whom he died. They went for uh for varieties of trips, whether it is pleasant trip, that trip, that this trip together. During one year of curse for Arjuna, he mostly spent with Krishna. So, yes.

01:35:59 - 01:36:07
Speaker 19: Sir. Hare Krishna sir. Uh sir, my question is sir, what is the meaning of Sankhya at this chapter known as Sankhya yoga?

01:36:07 - 01:36:09
Speaker 1: Sankhya means analysis.

01:36:11 - 01:36:12
Speaker 19: Okay, sir.

01:36:12 - 01:37:46
Speaker 1: Analysis. Understanding the ontology of the truth and trying to separate matter from spirit. This is matter, this is spirit. That is Sankhya. As Sankhya has a bigger connotation. And I don't want to go in detail and so I stop here uh because I have today for the first time we have gone beyond the limit that is 9:40. Thank you very much. Vancha kalpa tarubhyas ca krpa sindhubhya eva ca patitanam pavanebhyo vaisnavebhyo namo namah. Always remember the five uh uh what you call five uh sections. First surrendering to guru, second, description of the pure nature of the soul, then action according to material nature, action according to spiritual nature or Krishna consciousness, and ultimately action of perfected beings. Second chapter, you should not forget. Is that clear to everyone? Second chapter? Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
