Speaker 1: Hare Krishna. So, welcome everyone to Bhakti Shastri course. And I thank all of you for registering in this Bhakti Shastri course offered by Bhaktivedanta Gurukul and International School.

I'm not going to speak in Hindi. So, so that's a little warning for all of you that this will be an English class. So let us start. Let us start with our Mangalacharana. Um, all of you can sing with me, not repeat after me, but sing with me. Om ajnana-timirandhasya jnananjana-salakaya caksur unmilitam yena tasmai sri-gurave namah.

Hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare. Whenever we start discussion on Bhagavad Gita, that very time is most auspicious. Whenever you start, doesn't matter. We don't have to select an auspicious time to discussion Bhagavad Gita. The time when we start discussing Bhagavad Gita, at that time, time becomes supremely auspicious. by the grace of Sri Guru and Sri Krishna. Whenever we speak Bhagavad Gita, there is presence of Krishna and there is presence of Arjuna, his pure devotee. And whenever we get connected to the discussion on Bhagavad Gita, we naturally get transported to the divine realm of conversation where the speaker is the speaker is the absolute truth. And questioner is infinitesimal jiva. We are very insignificant, tiny cognitive unit. which is a spiritual spark of the unlimited cognitive being, which is called absolute truth. In Bhagavad Gita, Krishna very categorically saying that that very absolute truth comprises of five truth. The first truth is Ishvara. Ishvara means the controller. Controller of nature, controller of everything that exists, millions and trillions of spiritual and material universes. Jiva. So absolute truth includes Jiva. Whether we are understanding the absolute truth or not, whether we establish that relationship or not, we are originally belonging, we originally belong to him only, the absolute truth. In ignorance, we think we are independent of him, but when the torch light of Bhagavad Gita knowledge percolates within our heart, we see the grace of the absolute truth. And that very grace lets us know that we are resting in him, resting in him only. So Ishvara, all forms of Ishvara are empowered by him only. All jivas, they feel complete when connected to him only, the absolute truth. Time, the potency of the absolute truth that manifests the universe, that manifests the universal process of creation, maintenance, and destruction. This time is the supreme will of the absolute truth. You may desire something, I may desire something, we may plan, all of us we plan individually, ultimately the entire cosmos is running according to the will and arrangement of the absolute truth. And this is done by the time potency of Krishna. The fourth aspect of the same absolute truth, which is very significant from our perspective being conditioned, is the material nature. This material nature originally inert and formless. and looks like a dark cloud in the infinite spiritual sky, located at a very tiny corner. takes the shapes, take that very material energy takes the form of millions of millions of millions of universes simply by the glance of the absolute truth. And fifth aspect of the absolute truth is devotional service. Service that connects us to that absolute truth. So these five things together is the absolute truth. And Srila Prabhupada explained to us in the introduction to Bhagavad Gita, Ishvara, Jiva, Prakriti, Kala and Karma. Karma, why I did I translate as devotional service? Because karma that is binding to this ignorance. is the arrangement of the Lord. But karma when becomes devotional service, makes us being aware of that absolute truth. So karma that is not devotional service, makes us to remain ignorant about the absolute truth. And karma in the form of devotional service makes us aware of our connection to the absolute truth. So this uh this five things that we talk about in Bhagavad Gita, together is a complete whole. And Krishna presents in Bhagavad Gita that he himself is that complete whole. Mataha parataram nanyat kinchit asti Dhananjaya. Since we are starting Bhagavad Gita course chapter wise, I don't know why this uh course has been confined to only six chapters. I thought this will be all 18 chapters.

00:21:40 - 00:21:51
Speaker 2: So actually this said there are two more modules, if you want you can continue. So divided in three parts. So part one to six is one module, then 7 to 12 another, then 13 to 18 another module.

00:21:51 - 00:25:08
Speaker 1: Ah, okay, okay, okay. Fine, fine, fine, fine. All right. So, so, this great literature, Bhagavad Gita, is non-different from the form of the absolute truth, from the quality of the absolute truth, from the various manifestation of the absolute truth. And hence, this sacred literature must be taken very seriously because this talks us about our source, Vigyana. Today, a group of Odia students, they met me in my office in IIT Mandi. So I was telling them that in in modern connotation, they translate science as Vigyana without know without knowing what is Vigyana. Vigyana means to knowing our source. Like for example, I as an individual has a source in the form of my parents, in the form of my society, in the form of the vegetation that nourished my body, in the form of sunlight, moonlight that nourished me. in the form of my teachers who impregnated me with knowledge. And we I can go on. And ultimately, what is my ultimate source? That is Vigyana. And Bhagavad Gita tells us about this very beautiful ultimate science of everything. In fact, this particular sacred knowledge makes us understand that nobody knows the truth. Name Vidu Suragana.

00:25:13 - 00:25:13
Speaker 2: Prabhu.

00:25:14 - 00:32:33
Speaker 1: So this this sometime normal people getting a degree of Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, or a PhD, think that they know the truth. When we have such an attitude, we must be fools in disguise. The beauty of the absolute truth is that how much we may try to contemplate on that very nature, we will always remain, we will always fall short of understanding him. because he's the ultimately source of everything. is the ultimate source. That ultimate source cannot be conceived by any part. And hence, in the introduction to Bhagavad Gita, Srila Prabhupada started with the passage that we cannot understand him, but we can establish a relationship with him. part and whole. The relationship in neutrality, relationship as a servant, relationship as a friend, relationship as parents, relationship as lover. And these relationship are highest embodiment of divinity. The whole is connected to the the part is connected to the whole through a relationship. And that relationship is what we must take away from Bhagavad Gita. What is ultimately the take away from Bhagavad Gita is to develop an urge to understand my relationship, our relationship with that absolute truth. I'm not saying that it is a crime to understand that absolute truth. No. It is in fact a very divine process to inquire about the absolute truth, to gather knowledge about the absolute truth. However, such knowledge ultimately ends with the idea that we are very insignificant servant of that supremely divine master who acts as our best friend, who is our soul maintainer, sustainer, and his grace alone makes us feel complete. After all, the purpose of human life is to feel complete. Om purnamada purnamidam purnat purnamudachyate purnasya purnamadaya purnameva avashishyate. The absolute truth is always complete. Purna. So also, every unit that is emanating from him is also complete as long as it is aware of its source. So when I'm aware of my source, when I become aware of that source by that divine grace, I become naturally complete. So, I'm very happy to be with all of you. Radhakant Das has made some schedule. And uh every day we are going to meet for one and a half hour uh discussion and then half an hour some question answer. or one hour the lecture and half an hour question answer. Let us see how Lord Krishna will inspire us to get some beautiful pearls of wisdom by which we can endeavor to make our life complete. So with that introduction, I would read Gita Mahatmyam because we are starting. All of you can recite. Gita dhyana shilasya

00:32:34 - 00:32:37
Speaker 5: Gita dhyana shilasya

00:35:31 - 00:35:35
Speaker 5: Mukha padma vini

00:35:36 - 00:36:33
Speaker 1: Because Bhagavad Gita is spoken by the supreme personality of Godhead, one need not read any other Vedic literature. One need only attentively and regularly hear and read Bhagavad Gita. In the present age, people are so absorbed in mundane activities that it is not possible for them to read all Vedic literature. But this is not necessary. This one book, Bhagavad Gita, will suffice because it is the essence of all Vedic literature and especially because it is spoken by the supreme personality of Godhead. Next. Bharata amrita sarvasvam

00:36:33 - 00:36:37
Speaker 5: Bharata amrita sarvasvam

Speaker 5: Punar janma na vidyate

00:36:56 - 00:37:47
Speaker 1: One who drinks the water of the Ganges attains salvation. So what to speak of one who drinks the nectar of Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita is the essential nectar of Mahabharata. It is spoken by Lord Krishna himself, the original Vishnu. Bhagavad Gita comes from the mouth of supreme personality of Godhead, and the Ganges is said to emanate from the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course, there is no difference between the mouth and the feet of the Lord, but from an impartial study, we can appreciate that Bhagavad Gita is even more important than the water of the Ganges.

00:38:09 - 00:38:12
Speaker 5: Dugdham Gita amritam mahat

00:38:13 - 00:38:48
Speaker 1: This Gitopanishad, Bhagavad Gita, the essence of all Upanishads, is just like a cow. And Lord Krishna, who is famous as a cowherd boy, is milking this cow. Arjuna is just like a calf, and learned scholars and pure devotees are to drink the nectarian milk of Bhagavad Gita. Now we come to the last or seventh Mahatmyam. Ekam shastram Devaki putra gitam

00:38:48 - 00:38:53
Speaker 5: Ekam shastram Devaki putra gitam

00:38:54 - 00:38:57

00:39:14 - 00:39:19
Speaker 5: Karmapy ekam tasya devasya seva

00:39:20 - 01:05:26
Speaker 1: In this present day, people are very much eager to have one scripture, one God, one religion, and one occupation. Therefore, ekam shastram Devaki putra gitam. Let there be one scripture only, one common scripture for the whole world. Bhagavad Gita. Eko devo Devaki putra eva. Let there be one God for the whole world, Sri Krishna. Eko mantrasya namani And one him, one mantra, one prayer, the chanting of his name. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Karmapi ekam tasya devasya seva. And let there be one work only, the service of the supreme personality of Godhead. So dear devotees, we read the Gita Mahatmyas as given at the end of introduction to Bhagavad Gita by Srila Prabhupada himself. So I didn't read the verse and its translation. Rather, I went through the way Prabhupada has presented. So, taking the blessings of his divine grace, AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, we humbly start this discussion on Bhagavad Gita for the pleasure of all the devotees who have registered for this course. And those who have attended this who are attending this course. So, can you share from here the the PPTs? So we will start chapter wise. And let me tell you Bhagavad Gita, those all of you know because all of you are mostly devotees. Anybody who is outside would like to who has can someone raise your hand who is uh uh new to uh uh Bhagavad Gita? Um you have not uh attended any program within ISKCON or something like that? Is there any one? Okay. So, everybody um knows uh the Bhagavad Gita. So we have 18 chapters and we have 700 verses. And uh chapter one uh is Arjuna Vishada yoga. And when Prabhupad translated this one, observing uh the armies, observing the armies, that is how Prabhupad uh translated this chapter, observing the armies on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Arjuna Vishada yoga. So, uh this is uh chapter one and uh uh in what I do when I will do this course, first I will present the chapter and then I'll go through the chapter while reading every verse. Because I give importance to reading these verses, every verse and its meaning. Right? So that is what we are going to do. So today I am in the first class, I am going to present you the division of this chapter, theme wise. So there are are four themes in this chapter. First is introducing to warriors, two warrior groups. And this is being done by Duryodhan to his esteemed teacher, Dronacharya. Then blowing of the consoles. This starts when Duryodhan tells his teacher that everybody must give protection to the commander-in-chief, the grandsire, Bhishmadeva. Duryodhan had lot of faith in Bhishmadev. He was very sure that as long as Bhishmadev is there, nobody uh can snatch away victory from him. Because even in the Kuru assembly when Draupadi was disrobed, Bhishmadev had remained silent. And that gave enough inspiration to Duryodhan to think that grandsire Bhishma would ensure his victory. Then by Krishna's arrangement, Arjuna was shown two armies, but in a different way. He didn't see the two army that he is there as a as an instrument of Krishna to fight. He could not see that this battle has been arranged by Krishna such that the unwanted weeds will be wiped away. And Dharma would be established. So Arjuna observes two armies and becomes morose by Krishna's arrangement. Because Krishna wanted to deliver us something very wonderful in the middle of battlefield where millions have gathered. to fight. to establish what is Dharma by the will of Krishna. And this chapter ends with Arjuna's arguments not to fight. So this very organization uh is uh uh uh let me uh tell you that introduction of two warrior groups, that is uh one to 11. Um what are the two warrior groups? That is Kauravas and Pandavas. And there is a partiality of Dhritarashtra as he refers his sons as Kauravas in the very beginning. Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra samaveta yuyutsava mamaka Pandava kim kurvata Sanjaya. And while introducing Duryodhan feels that his group is far superior. Just like we in our ignorance, we always realize that things are under my control. But those who know what is Bhagavad Gita, they they are very clear that nobody in this world is in control, including Bhishmadev. Including Arjuna. The only controller who is in control, that is Krishna. So this very idea that I feel confident of things are under my control is not a very good idea. Which the modern civilization uh pushes this very idea. But the very idea in Bhagavad Gita you will see to derive confidence in anything that we do with the assumption that Krishna is in control makes life very fulfilling. We will we are going to discuss. So, verse number 1 to 11, this is about uh uh introduction of two armies according to uh Dhritarashtra. according to Duryodhan. Now, from verse number 12 to 19, this is the second uh theme or section, blowing of consoles. And this blowing of console started with Bhishma because he wanted to encourage Duryodhan. Because Bhishma already knows the end of Duryodhan is very near. Bhishma also knows that his end is there. Bhishma knows that everyone who are on the side of Duryodhan will meet their end because for Bhishma, there is no confusion about the role of or about the position of Krishna. In great Rajasuya yagna, he has already advocated that Krishna must get must get the agra puja. Krishna Krishna is the samam bonum of everything. And he inspired Sahadev to present Krishna as absolute truth to the whole universe. Because in the Rajasuya yagna of Yudhishthira Maharaj, the entire universe was present. Starting with Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma, Indra, and great warriors, great Maharsis, great devotees. Everyone were present. And when very big people are there, even if you know something about Krishna, you cannot speak. It becomes very difficult. This is moving. Yes sir. Huh? And uh you should have told me. Uh so uh what I was saying? I forgot. It becomes difficult. Yeah, when, you know, in a in a in a in a in a in a great assembly where the entire universe is present, going there and to speak about Krishna, means that shows how empowered Sahadev must be. And uh obviously Bhishma being a Mahajana knows the truth, knows the end of the Duryodhan and his party including himself. This is the essence of Bhagavad Gita. By Krishna's arrangement, sometime we may be in his party or in his opposition party. That situation we don't create. It is created by Krishna's arrangement. But whichever way we are there, as long as we embrace the grace of Krishna, then we will always remain joyful. So Bhishma blew his console and Kauravas celebrated that with blowing of consoles, drums, biggles, resulting in a tumultuous sound. In response, Lord Krishna blew the Panchajanya, the divine console. Arjuna blew Devadatta, Bhima blew Paundra, Yudhishthira blew Anantavijaya, Nakula blew Sughosha, Sahadev blew Manipushpaka. As a result, this divine sound created a heartbreak among the followers of Duryodhana. A devotee can digest any kind of material explosion. Any kind of material difficulties, very uh the very situation that is uh beyond our imagination, we can a devotee can go through that. But non-devotees cannot digest the divinity. Divinity is the torch light of knowledge that makes us to see the absolute truth. Non-devotees do not want to see that. And hence their hearts were shattered. They want to remain in ignorance. They don't want to come to the light. So, this itself is the sign of victory for Pandavas. And in section three, observation of both armies by Arjuna, which is verse number 20 to 27, So, where Krishna is making Arjuna see everyone in terms of filial relationship. Bodily relationship. The relationship that makes us ignorant, confused. We are here in this world by virtue of Krishna, not virtue, not by the virtue of any XYZ we imagine, like chemical origin of life. There are so many theories. I don't want to go there. So this bodily relationship which is the real cause of ignorance in this material world. was revealed to Krishna, revealed to Arjuna by the arrangement of Krishna. As such, Arjuna is never confused because he is the pure devotee of Krishna. But here, Krishna is using Arjuna to see the world as is bodily relationship, which makes him morose. So, Vishada yoga starts, Arjuna sinks. And finally, the fourth section, Arjuna's arguments against fighting, verse number 28 to 46. Because of filial relation, Arjuna I missed those couplets. So, the compassion for relatives. So Arjuna is able to see that Duryodhan and his party are not able to see the devastation that is going to cause. This battle is going to cause the devastation. What is that devastation? It's a loss of family only. Whether Duryodhan wins or Arjuna wins, one party will be completely swiped out. So Arjuna's argument is that I am able to see that. He is not able to see. So for whom we are trying to get this victory? We want to achieve success in life to give joy to our near and dear ones. But those near and dear ones would not be there around me when this battle is over. And then Arjuna's argument is very powerful argument is when I am in knowledge, I do something that is ghastly, I would incur more sin than those who indulge in sinful activities in ignorance. And then Arjuna's argument is that when millions and millions will be killed, means millions and millions of widows will be there in the society. And they will be unprotected. And unprotected woman is not good for the society because that would cause adultery, Varna Shankara. And with those argument, Arjuna finally decides not to fight. So this is the summum bonum of the first chapter. Tomorrow we are going to start verse by verse. We will cover the entire 46 verses. So let us recapitulate. Verse number 1 to 11. That is introducing two warrior groups, who are with Pandavas, who are with Kauravas. Second, the verse number 12, I think 19, that is blowing of the con cells. And 20 to 28, Arjuna observes both army. which makes him morose. He develops filial compassion, bodily compassion. and forgets the purpose of life. Purpose of life is to fulfill the mission of Krishna, which he forgets. And then as a compassionate person, he gives argument against fighting from the verse number 28 to 46. So this is the chapter one. We are also going to discuss what is the significance, what are the takeaways. Whenever we will discuss Bhagavad Gita, first we will our always the methodology is we will try to look at this chapter theme wise, how it is progressing. And then we will understand that how the chapter at a not cell by going verse wise discussion. And then the takeaway from this chapter. That is the third part. The takeaway from this chapter is what I would say is my own realization after reading Bhagavad Gita for 30 more than 30 years. And then we would go through the some of the purpose of Bhagavad Gita. We cannot read because 46 verses, 46 purpose if you read, that will be very tough. So, we will go some of the purpose of Prabhupad and would ask some pertinent question, what Prabhupad is trying to ask here. So, uh what those questions we would like to answer by which we can internalize the purpose of Prabhupad. So, some of the purpose we will revisit in detail. And ultimately, we will come to the quoted verses in every chapter. And I request all of you to memorize some of the key verses from this chapter and quoted verses from this chapter. They are very important. When I started my journey in Bhagavad Gita, I enjoyed remembering the quoted verse of Prabhupada. That gave me great strength to preach to others. And sometimes I will also narrate some some of those experiences that I have. So, thank you very much. Uh for listening to me. This is the time for question answer. A someone is having some uh process by which okay, Mahasundari has raised hand. You can ask your question.

01:05:27 - 01:06:18
Speaker 6: Hare Krishna. Thank you Prabhuji for this overview of chapter one. So, Prabhuji, just wanted to have ask one doubt that as you have mentioned in the introduction part, the Krishna is absolute truth, means wherever you were speaking, like you said the beauty of absolute truth is that how much we can try to contemplate about the nature of the absolute truth. And in all your lines, you were using absolute truth. So I have a doubt, then where should we use absolute truth? When we should use supreme personality of Godhead? When we should use Krishna? Because I have heard in lectures that there is a purpose behind behind every word used in Bhagavad Gita.

01:06:20 - 01:11:03
Speaker 1: Very good question. There is no distinction between Krishna, the absolute truth, the supreme personality of Godhead. They are one. They are always one. Concept wise, absolute truth is very powerful because that which includes everything, the whole. That is absolute truth. But when we talk about Krishna, we feel localized. So, we should not, that's why antar. He simultaneously present within me. Ishwara Sarva Bhutanam. He's there within everyone. He's also there outside. He's there everywhere. So, when we say, when we look at Arjuna and Krishna, we see two individual. But when you try to see Arjuna and Krishna, you should realize that Arjuna is within Krishna, not vice versa. So this uh and supreme personality of Godhead. That which includes everything has a personality. And that personality doesn't appear to be that absolute whole. Just like the example of Krishna's visit to Janakpuri where the brahmana is feeling Krishna is with him. Bechara Raja. Raja is poor because he's coming to my house. And Raja, the king who is there to welcome Krishna, he is thinking bechara Brahman, the poor Brahman because Krishna is with me. This is a inconceivable potency of Krishna. That nobody can break that uh uh uh confidentiality or whatever, that only Krishna can do. So he's the whole, but simultaneously is friend of everyone in such a way that each one of us we reciprocate with Krishna not as a whole, but as my lover, as my friend, as my master. So, before we can accept Krishna as supreme personality of Godhead, or accept Krishna as friend of Arjuna, we must understand Krishna as the absolute truth. And this is corroborated in the verse number 10.8 where Krishna is saying Aham sarvasya prabhavo mata sarvam pravate iti matva bhajante ma Buddha bhava samanvita. To approach Krishna as a supreme personality of Godhead, first we have to understand Krishna as the absolute truth. Iti matva when one understand Krishna to be the absolute truth because the source of everything. Then only the bhajan starts, worship starts. Is that clear to you?

01:11:07 - 01:11:08
Speaker 6: Yes, Prabhuji.

01:11:10 - 01:11:12
Speaker 1: Okay. Next, Sachin.

01:11:13 - 01:11:29
Speaker 7: Hare Krishna Prabhuji, Dandavat Pranam. Uh Prabhuji, my question is like in what way like which we should hear this Bhagavad Gita, like what should be our mood so we can like gain and realize this thing, uh this knowledge.

01:11:29 - 01:11:53
Speaker 1: You are not doing that. Now you are doing the very same thing. There is nothing to be done. You are listening now. You are doing this course. So this very process is the process. There is no other process.

01:11:57 - 01:11:58
Speaker 7: Thank you.

01:11:59 - 01:12:00
Speaker 1: Sarvatma Das.

01:12:03 - 01:12:29
Speaker 8: Hare Krishna sir. Sir, regarding this guru parampara, just like at the end of introduction, guru parampara is given how knowledge has been transferred. Sir, a question is like what happened to that or is the parampara where Krishna has given knowledge to Arjuna, then Arjuna like what happened to that line?

01:12:31 - 01:15:26
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is why we have to hear from the teacher. When Arjuna is speaking to sorry, Krishna is speaking to Arjuna, that very conversation is assimilated simultaneously by bonafide parampara. So when Arjuna is speaking to sorry, Krishna is speaking to Arjuna, and I read that, I if I am situated in parampara, then by reading this conversation between Arjuna and Krishna, I will accept Krishna the way Arjuna accepted him. I will understand Krishna's message the way Arjuna understood him. So this is a very divine process. So when Krishna does any action, that is always so divine. And when that very process is had in parampara, that can be directly revealed. Pratyaksham avagamyam sukam kartum avyam. Rajavidya Rajaguyam pavitram. So only when we are situated in parampara, the message of Krishna for Arjuna is directly revealed to us. So your question, what happens to the parampara of Arjuna Krishna Arjuna samvada parampara? That question is faulty in the sense Krishna is delivering divine message and that process is beyond time and space. And you have to drink the nectar from that process. And to drink the nectar in its sweetest form, you have to be situated in parampara.

01:15:31 - 01:16:18
Speaker 8: Are you clear? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sir, one follow-up question, sir, regarding this. Uh sir, in fourth chapter we hear that Krishna says that I have given this knowledge first to sun God. Uh so there Prabhupad mentions like before before so much before 120 million years. And at the same time, we hear that Krishna spoken to Arjuna 5,000 years before. And sir, is it not that Krishna has not spoken this in the previous Chatur Yuga, in the previous Dwapara Yuga of

01:16:18 - 01:18:17
Speaker 1: Every time he speaks, every time he speaks. His message which has been recorded, that is beyond space and time. That's what I told. Any bonafide parampara can have access to that message. Just like Vyasdev sitting on the bank of Saraswati could see the Srimad Bhagavatam in entirety. Exactly in the same way, whenever Krishna intends to give a message, that message is broadcasted in the medium of transcendental space and time. You have to have a proper receiver to receive it. So, just like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he had many branches. Some branch became powerful, some branch got dwindled by influence of time. So it happens in this material world because that transcendental message is captured and then it is transmitted within this material world. Some branches do well, some branches don't do well. And ultimately, this how powerful may be the message, how powerful may be the branches, it may come to an end and Krishna has to again start, rejuvenate the process.

01:18:21 - 01:18:22
Speaker 8: Thank you, sir. Hare Krishna.

01:18:29 - 01:18:30
Speaker 1: Sarvagya Gauranga.

01:18:31 - 01:19:11
Speaker 3: Hare Krishna sir. Uh sir, like you told this karma is devotional service like the devotional service the comes that absolute truth consists of these five topics like and the fifth one is devotional service. So but by definition absolute truth means like it it should include everything. Uh that that is so like if if if karma is only devotional service then what what about the the the activities those are not devotional service.

01:19:12 - 01:19:35
Speaker 1: They are illusion. They are illusion. That's what I told. When it is not devotional service, that makes you forget about the absolute truth. So that is illusion. So that illusion is also part of the absolute truth.

01:19:37 - 01:19:39
Speaker 3: Okay, that is not karma, that is illusion.

01:19:40 - 01:19:47
Speaker 1: Yeah. When yes, that illusion manifest in the form of karma.

01:19:48 - 01:19:48
Speaker 3: Okay.

01:19:51 - 01:20:07
Speaker 1: When you are illusioned, you act in the illusion. You can't make a distinction. The karma and illusion are different. The same thing.

01:20:10 - 01:20:18
Speaker 3: And sir, like where in Bhagavad Gita it is said like this absolute truth consists of this five aspects like where in Bhagavad Gita it is mentioned?

01:20:19 - 01:20:52
Speaker 1: That only a pure devotee can explain to you. Okay? So that this this this we have already this this particular point we have already taken in Bhagavad Gita, uh, what is that? The thematic course, five aspect of the absolute truth. Okay? So they are being discussed in different different aspects. Right?

01:20:53 - 01:20:53
Speaker 3: Yeah.

01:20:54 - 01:20:54
Speaker 1: Yeah.

01:20:55 - 01:20:56
Speaker 3: Thank you.

01:20:58 - 01:20:58
Speaker 1: Ria.

01:21:02 - 01:21:28
Speaker 9: You are not audible. Hare Krishna Prabhuji, pranam. Uh Prabhuji, as you mentioned that the takeaway from Bhagavad Gita is one must develop the urge to understand one's relationship with the absolute truth. So will this happen only once we are done with all the 18 chapters? And secondly, what should be one's mood to start reading or understanding Bhagavad Gita so that we can achieve this result towards the as a takeaway?

01:21:30 - 01:29:24
Speaker 1: The mood is uh that of a devotee. That's all. We don't have to extend much. Mood is that of a devotee. We trust Krishna. We recognize that whatever Krishna is speaking, I don't understand, but that is true. So, whatever, in Bhagavad Gita, Krishna has already told, nobody understands him. And somebody says, no, I understand Krishna. He must be a stupid fellow. When Krishna says nobody understands, nobody. And if he says somebody understand Krishna, that is stupidity. And there he has categorized. Name. Neither demigods, nor great sages. So when Krishna speaks something, we may not we don't understand. You know, even if we read Bhagavad Gita, time again and again, it is not that we will understand Bhagavad Gita, understand Krishna as he is. But every time we will read, we will make little progress towards Krishna. Little devotee, little more devotion to Krishna because our scientific understanding of the absolute truth makes us to appreciate Krishna and to glorify him. And hence, we have to be in right platform. Bhagavad Gita is a science, it's not a sentimental literature. So more and more we read, little and little, we'll make progress by our devotion to Krishna. So that should be the mood of studying Bhagavad Gita. And as you rightly pointed, the ultimate aim of Bhagavad Gita is Sarva Dharman Parityajya Mam Ekam Sharanam Vraja. This Vraja here is also refers to the Vraja of Vrindavan, Vraja Vrindavan. So, you know, I I I cannot go to the esoteric side of Bhagavad Gita because let's remain here, but the point here is that ultimately, Krishna manifests completely or Krishna reveals himself completely within the realm of Vraja. And that is the last supreme instruction of Krishna. So how sweetness of Krishna was tasted by each and every one in Vraj. That is the ultimate takeaway. But this is little esoteric and because Bhagavad Gita is have been given to everyone. That is why you see in in in in India, no one would say a single word against Bhagavad Gita. People may say many ugly words against Bhagavat Purana, Vishnu Purana, this Purana, that Purana. But no sect within within India would ever speak a single word against Bhagavad Gita. Everybody, every lineage. Because Krishna is so wonderful. He only speaks that much in a language, he doesn't give any scope for people to find any fault in Bhagavad Gita. But those who are devotees of Krishna, they understand Bhagavad Gita completely differently. Everybody will manifest from Bhagavad Gita. For devotees of Krishna, they will take from Bhagavad Gita something different. Which Prabhupada has said, you know, this as I explained to you that ultimately Bhagavad Gita is meant to make us. That's why Krishna says the chatur shloki which is so famous. That I am buddhi yogam. So, Krishna directly reveals to his devotees the way he is. Krishna also directly reveals himself to yogis in a different way. Krishna directly reveals to gyanis another way. Krishna reveals to karmis in another way. But he reveals everyone he gives the intelligence so that they make little, little, little, little, little progress. But we are very fortunate being part of devotee family. And devotee family, not only devotee family, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's family. So, when we hear the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, then we get more pearls from Bhagavad Gita. So while Krishna speaks, he can use a language by which he would give one form of information to gyanis, another form of information to dhyanis, another form of information to bhaktas, devotees. That is his because he's he he is the best linguist.

01:29:29 - 01:29:46
Speaker 10: Abhay Chaitanya Das. Hare Krishna sir. Sir, what is the difference between absolute truth and Ishwar aspect? So when Krishna manifests himself as Vishnu or Narayan, don't they constitute absolute truth?

01:29:48 - 01:32:12
Speaker 1: No. Vishnu and Krishna, Vishnu or Narayana are partial embodiment of the absolute truth. As far as the the controller aspect is concerned, the jiva aspect is concerned, and all those things are there. These five aspects are also embedded within Vishnu, within Narayana, but these five aspects are completely present within Krishna as the absolute truth. Because devotees that are within Krishna in uh they the super uh uh supreme nature of devotees around Krishna are absent in the realm of Vishnu, Rama, uh even Dwarakadhisa. So that is why, but these are all confidential thing. I don't want to discuss much about it because we are teaching Bhagavad Gita as of now at a preliminary level. Let us keep our discussion only at a preliminary level. Maybe sometime we can dive deeper into Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's description of Krishna as the absolute truth. But as of now, we should be satisfied. Krishna and Vishnu and Rama and Jagannatha and Dwarakadhisa all in the same realm. Otherwise, we'll make a mess of it. It's better to take them in the same platform in the beginning of our devotional service.

01:32:13 - 01:32:25
Speaker 10: Sir, another related question is that where do Lord Shiva, Mother Durga, Radharani and Lakshmi fit into this scheme of this five aspect, the Ishwara, Jiva, Kala.

01:32:32 - 01:33:49
Speaker 1: Lord Shiva is also a controller. So also Parvati, so also Radharani. Krishna as controller has manifested in various forms. I go in trekking uh in this Mandi area, IIT Mandi nearby. So when I'm chanting in those pathways going up the hill, you know, you could feel these places are dwelled by Lord Shiva and his consort. This is Himalaya, it is his place. So, so the names that you uttered, they are all aspect of the controller, Ishwara.

01:33:54 - 01:33:55
Speaker 10: Thank you, sir.

01:33:57 - 01:34:23
Speaker 1: So we should stop. 9:00, spot on we are exactly. So we said 7:30 to 9:00. Thank you all. I'll see you again, I think tomorrow, tomorrow? Tomorrow. Tomorrow, same time. Hare Krishna. Vancha Kalpataru Kripa Sindhu Patita Pavane Vaishnave.
