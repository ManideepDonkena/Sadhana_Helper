# Mind State Laboratory

**Mind State Laboratory** is a suite of interactive diagnostic games designed to analyze various cognitive and physiological states, including focus, impulse control, motor stability, and reaction time.

## 🎮 Available Diagnostics

The laboratory features 7 distinct tools:

1.  **Focus Orb** (Sustained Attention)
    *   Keep your mouse cursor inside a moving orb.
    *   Measures your ability to maintain focus on a dynamic target over time.

2.  **Zen Circle** (Motor Stability)
    *   Trace a circle slowly and perfectly.
    *   Analyzes fine motor control and steadiness.

3.  **Don't Click** (Impulse Control)
    *   A "Simon Says" style game where you must resist fake triggers.
    *   Measures your ability to inhibit impulsive responses.

4.  **Microscope** (Nervous Tension)
    *   Hold your mouse absolutely still within a small zone.
    *   Detects micro-movements and nervous tremors.

5.  **Breath Sync** (Mind-Body Sync)
    *   Synchronize your breathing (via spacebar) with a visual rhythm.
    *   Tests the connection between your physical actions and visual cues.

6.  **Vigilance** (Alertness)
    *   React instantly when a light flashes in a grid.
    *   Measures raw reaction time in milliseconds.

7.  **Grounding** (Anxiety Relief)
    *   A guided 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique.
    *   Helps reduce anxiety and center the mind in the present moment.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

*   **HTML5**: Semantic structure and canvas elements.
*   **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS variables, flexbox/grid, and animations.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core game logic, state management, and rendering loops.
